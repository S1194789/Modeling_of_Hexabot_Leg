# üï∑Ô∏è Hexapod Leg Modeling & Simulation

This repository contains the **kinematic modeling and simulation of a hexapod leg** using **Matlab/Simulink**. The project focuses on analyzing **degrees of freedom (DOF)**, computing the **Jacobian matrix**, and simulating **controlled leg movement** using the **Simscape Multibody Toolbox**. The goal is to evaluate whether the hexapod leg can generate stable forward motion without unwanted body movement.
